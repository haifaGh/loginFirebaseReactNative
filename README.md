# loginFirebaseReactNative
This is a basic project that login/sign using Firebase authentiction service using a react native app.
All what you have to do is to run this command npm install Firebase --save, create your own database in 
the Firebase Console, enable the sign_in method and change your firebaseConfig with your own in the index.ios.js. 

PS:this is an example for ios but it works perfectly with android.
